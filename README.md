Project Proposal: Maternal Mortality and Literacy Analysis

Team Members
- Isabella Colindres
- Natalie Chen
- Vincent Tran

Project Overview

Format:
We will analyze two datasets using data wrangling and modeling tools in R.

Goal:
Our goal is to identify countries with the highest maternal mortality rates and examine their association with adult female literacy rates.

Detailed Plans and Timeline

1. Merging Datasets: Thursday, 12/5
- Combine IHME maternal mortality ratios (1990–2011) with Our World in Data female literacy rates (1970–2022).
2. Proposal Submission: Friday, 12/6
3. Analyze Merged Dataset: Saturday, 12/7
4. Work on Website Descriptions and References: Sunday, 12/8
- Include an introductory page, references, and ethical considerations.
5. Data Visualization Implementation: Monday, 12/9
- Each team member will create one interactive visualization.
6. Finalize Website: Tuesday, 12/10 (and Wednesday 12/11 as needed)
- Polish the Shiny web application as the final product, ensuring all visualizations and analyses are integrated.
7. Present to class: Thursday, 12/12
  
Final Deliverable

The Shiny application will include:
- An introduction page with an overview of the project, data sources, and ethical considerations.
- Three interactive visualizations highlighting key findings from the data analysis.
- A conclusion page summarizing major takeaways and insights.
  
This project will explore the critical relationship between maternal health and literacy, aiming to highlight global disparities and inform public health priorities.
